            Since its inception in 2000, French-based underground label Ultimae Records has been setting the global
            standard for what could broadly be called ambient trance and its various genre spin-offs. For a broad
            view of the label check out the superb various-artist collections of the Fahrenheit Project series
            (2001-2007); for a close-up of individual talent on Ultimae look no further than Swedish duo Johannes
            Hedberg and Daniel Segerstad, aka Carbon Based Lifeforms.
            Carbon Based Lifeforms earliest releases were several self-published albums originally issued through
            the old MP3.com portal and since reissued by the band. Listening to them now it's clear at that point
            that the various elements of their sound were still coalescing.
